# Project Name: Responsible crop production based on the market and food demand

## Short Description:
# What's the problem?
Food products are an essential commodity for the survival of the human race on this planet. The agriculture sector is growing food crops in order to meet the increasing demands of the market. Globalisation has aided in exports and imports of consumables across the globe. However, often we see around the world the news of food crops being wasted because of reduced/minimum demand in the market. On the other hand, we often come across articles and documentaries of people around the globe, starving and facing food shortages due to loopholes in the Supply chain management as well as due to inadequate knowledge of the demand for a particular food crop. 
Hence, it becomes important to indulge in sustainable practices to produce the amount of food crop that would help meet the required demand and also would ensure no individual faces shortage of food. 

# How can technology help?
Technology can help reduce the wastage of food through effective analysis of the food data and generate vital information. Thus, it is helpful in making better and responsible decisions. Data Analytics is one such field of Technology that will enable us to implement this thought over our application for obtaining real-time efficiency in terms of food production and consumption. 

# The idea
Data has taken over the world by storm. Using the same data, we intend to analyse the food consumption rate of any crop across the globe and forecast its demand in the future. Based on the demand, it is possible to produce the food crop at an appropriate amount in a region(at any part of the globe) which is suitable for cultivation based on past history of food production.
This idea can be backed by the food consumption and food production dataset and along with the help of IBM cloud services, it can be better visualised and analysed which can be used by the higher authorities to plan the production channel of the crop across the nation or globe.

# Obtaining the Dataset
Data Cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Visualization
Creation of Dashboard
Model Deployment
Report Generation

# Long Description:
Two open-sourced datasets each on food production and food consumption were taken into consideration for the development of the project. 
Dataset description:
Food production: Has values of the food crop, country, amount of crop produced, year
Food consumption: Consists values for food crop, country, amount of crop consumed, year
Population: Consists of the population of every country in the world

# Data cleaning:
The key aspect for any Data Science project is to clean and transform the data to the solution-specific task. This was achieved by using the Pandas library available in Python.

# Exploratory Data Analysis:
The transformed dataset is uploaded to IBM Cognos Analytics for further analysis and exploration of the data.

# Data Visualization:
The data module generated by integrating the datasets(in .csv format) is taken as a source for visualization using different types of charts. A dashboard is created for the visualization of relevant tasks to be performed

# Deployment:
A Linear regression model is developed to obtain data on the prominent countries with a demand for a particular food crop in the upcoming years and to map it with the corresponding countries which are capable of producing the food crop given its previous food production capabilities. 

# Report generation:
A report is generated in HTML format which is easy to understand and which gives visual representation of the inference obtained through the Machine Learning model.


# Project Name:
Responsible crop production based on the market and food demand

# About the project:
The project is aimed at creating an effective producer-consumer relationship chain wherein, the producers, agriculturists or farmers in this case grow food crops in an appropriate quantity  based on the global demand of the crop. 
The real-time crop demand is forecasted based on the parameters of food consumption and population growth in a particular country using Regression analysis and the generated data is used as benchmark for the producing appropriate amount of crops by the nations based on their crop cultivation history. The countries having maximum demand/production for a food crop can be determined and can facilitate globalization.

# Sections & Sub-sections:
1.1 Data Visualization and Dashboard creation
The transformed dataset is uploaded to IBM Cognos Analytics for further analysis and exploration of the data. A dashboard is created for the visualization of relevant tasks to be performed. A report is generated in HTML format which is easy to understand and which gives visual representation of the inference obtained through the Machine Learning model.

1.2 Machine Learning model for Food consumption prediction
A Linear regression model is developed to obtain data on the prominent countries with a demand for a particular food crop in the upcoming years and to map it with the corresponding countries which are capable of producing the food crop given its previous food production capabilities. 

# Conclusions:
From the above methods, it can be concluded that, with effective visualization and utilization of available algorithms in the field of Data Science, it is possible to establish an efficient producer-consumer chain with minimal wastage and maximum utilization of food crops.

# Results:
The Regression model has proven an accuracy of 90% to predict the demand in the consumption of food crops.

# Project Roadmap:
The project currently does the following things:
Visualise the production and consumption of a particular food crop across the globe

Get information about the countries where the crops are in demand (for exports)

Get information about the countries which can fulfil the growing demand for a food commodity through increased agricultural production across the world (for imports) 

It's in a free tier IBM Cognos Analytics software. In the future we plan to store, run and visualise the data completely using IBM tools with a user friendly interface in a web portal for easy access and understanding.
We also intend to develop a system which when given with the name of a particular country/region, gives information about the crops grown, the consumer market it can take into advantage and the expected growth in population and increase in the demand for the food crop.

# Getting Started:
We refer to the Pandas official documentation and Python official documentation for the purpose of this application. Once the application is on run we can work with multiple data to analyse and gain specific information related to different food products. Within the application year wise data of the food consumption in India and other countries can be known along with visualization. This type of information can be gathered for different types of food products. The application also gives access to understanding the food product(s) which was specifically consumed highly and in which country. We can compare this information with respect to different years and also effectively calculate the average of the gathered data. Also, it gives specific data of the food consumption rate in India in different years and specifically in units of tonnes. For example, based on the application execution using cognos analysis we have gained information that in the year 2019 in India cereals and pulses have been consumed at a higher rate around 2 lakhs, which being the highest. Overall we can have created an application that would produce specific and required information based on the original datasets collected year wise from different countries. The information on the level of Food Production and Food Consumption around the world. Also, we can compare the data accordingly and better analyse the extracted information. Here, although we have used datasets from the year 2012 - 2013, the application can also be utilized to infer information on different datasets of other countries from different years.
